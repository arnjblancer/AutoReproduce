Incremental learning provides critical adaptability in dynamic environments, enabling models to continuously
adjust with new data to improve prediction accuracy. This adaptability is especially valuable in volatile ﬁnancial
markets, where incremental learning can help model better capture the emerging patterns of time series data.
On the other hand, self-supervised learning gained signiﬁcant attention during the past few years due to its
ability to exploit abundant unlabeled data to uncover complex structures and temporal dependencies, improving
model generalization and pattern detection, which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of data
structures. In this case, it gradually become a powerful tool in the ﬁeld of time series analysis, especially in
ﬁnancial domain. In parallel, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential in decision-making
tasks, particularly in ﬁnancial strategy optimization. However, most DRL approaches in ﬁnance rely solely on
raw market data, limiting the model’s ability to extract key insights and often ignoring future trends essential
for proﬁtable trading. To address the aforementioned challenge appeared in DRL domain, Incremental Forecast
Fusion Deep Reinforcement Learning (IFF-DRL), an innovative framework that combines incremental learning
and self-supervised learning with DRL for ﬁnancial trading is proposed, for accurately and continually optimizing
and improving trading strategies. In this paper, AutoConNet, as a self-supervised learning method, is incorporated
to forecast future OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume) data based on observed values. During testing,
incremental learning dynamically reﬁnes the predictive model to stay aligned with market trends. By utilizing
incremental learning algorithms, the self-supervised time series prediction network, AutoConNet, achieved an
average reduction of 5.93 % in MSE error across six datasets during the testing phase. The predicted OHLCV
is combined with actual observed OHLCV to generate “weekly data”, forming the state space termed “daily &
weekly data” in reinforcement learning. Experiments conducted on six datasets show that the proposed IFFDRL signiﬁcantly improves trading performance, delivering an annualized return of 103.19 % on the HSI index.
By combining incremental learning with reinforcement learning, IFF-DRL enables trading agents to adapt more
eﬀectively in fast-paced markets, capturing proﬁt opportunities and oﬀering a more responsive, future-oriented
approach in ﬁnancial decision-making. Code of this research can be found in https://github.com/AndyZCJ/

1. Introduction
Accurately predicting and making timely decisions in dynamic, highstakes environments like ﬁnancial markets has long been a central challenge in artiﬁcial intelligence. While recent advancements in ﬁnancial
time series modeling have achieved some success in capturing market

patterns (Wang et al., 2024; Weng, Ahmed, & Megahed, 2017; Weng,
Lu, Wang, Megahed, & Martinez, 2018), these models often fail to respond eﬀectively to rapid and abrupt market changes, leading to suboptimal trading outcomes. A key limitation of traditional models lies
in their oﬄine training on historical data, which prevents them from
adapting in real time as new data becomes available. This constraint has

motivated the exploration of incremental learning as a promising approach for dynamic data prediction (Li & Dai, 2019; Li, Dai, & Ye, 2019;
Melgar-García, Gutiérrez-Avilés, Rubio-Escudero, & Troncoso, 2023). In
ﬁnancial markets, incremental learning allows continuous model updates as new data arrives, enabling models to quickly adapt to evolving
data patterns and improve prediction accuracy without retraining from
scratch.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained considerable attention due
to its capacity to optimize decision-making in uncertain, dynamic environments, including gaming (Kaiser et al., 2019; Lample & Chaplot,
2017; Zhou, Subagdja, Tan, & Ong, 2021b), ﬁne-tuning of large language models (Achiam et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023), and notably, algorithmic trading (Huang, Wan, Zhang, & Lu, 2024a; Huang, Zhou, Cui,
& Lu, 2024c). The dynamic and unpredictable nature of ﬁnancial markets makes them particularly suitable for RL applications, as RL agents
can iteratively learn and improve trading strategies based on continuous
feedback from the market. However, despite the development of robust
algorithms and frameworks in applying RL methods within the ﬁnancial domain, notable shortcomings persist, particularly in data handling.
Speciﬁcally, a signiﬁcant portion of existing work relies solely on raw
market price data, such as daily Open, High, Low, and Close prices, as
well as trading Volume (OHLCV). Some studies even use only the closing price as the model input (Chen & Gao, 2019; Li, Ni, & Chang, 2020).
This reliance on static or oﬄine data limits RL models’ ability to capture
rapid market shifts, which are often essential to seizing proﬁtable trading opportunities. Although recent eﬀorts have attempted to increase
data diversity by incorporating additional indicators, such as technical
signals or social media sentiment (Friedman & Fontaine, 2018; Yang,
Liu, Zhong, & Walid, 2020), this approach introduces latency, as these
indicators are generated after the fact and fail to capture immediate
market changes.
Moreover, most RL models rely primarily on historical price movements, often neglecting the potential impact of external factors such as
political events, wars, or international relations. These factors can lead
to sudden and new market shifts, making trading decisions based solely
on historical data risky, as it may result in missed opportunities or substantial losses. Consequently, there is a pressing need for models that
not only learn from historical data but also adapt to evolving market
conditions and external inﬂuences.
To address these challenges, this paper introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that combines incremental learning
with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for enhanced ﬁnancial decisionmaking. Incremental learning enables the model to continuously update as new data arrives, adapting to evolving market trends without
retraining from scratch, which is crucial in ﬁnancial markets where
rapid adaptation is essential. By integrating incremental learning, the
model can maintain performance over time, eﬀectively handling nonstationary data distributions and mitigating the eﬀects of concept drift
(Li & Dai, 2019; Li et al., 2019; Melgar-García et al., 2023). Selfsupervised learning leverages large amounts of unlabeled data abundant in ﬁnancial markets. SSL creates auxiliary tasks that uncover complex structures and temporal dependencies within the data without requiring manual labels, enhancing the model’s ability to generalize and
detect subtle shifts in patterns. Additionally, SSL is eﬀective in producing robust predictions, even in the presence of market noise and
volatility.
In our framework, we integrate a self-supervised time-series prediction network with the classical incremental learning algorithm Elastic
Weight Consolidation (EWC) (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) within a deep reinforcement learning architecture. The self-supervised network predicts
stock price movements over the next 𝑁 days, enabling the RL agent to
anticipate future price changes. To capture both daily ﬂuctuations and
macro-level patterns, the predicted stock prices are combined with observed prices to generate weekly data. This weekly data is then concatenated with daily data, forming what we term “daily & weekly data.” This
combined dataset provides the RL agent with a nuanced view of market

trends across diﬀerent time frames, enhancing its ability to make timely,
data-driven trading decisions.
In summary, by integrating incremental learning and self-supervised
learning into the reinforcement learning framework, the proposed approach addresses the limitations of existing ﬁnancial RL models. Incremental learning allows the model to swiftly adapt to new data, essential for dynamic environments like ﬁnancial markets. Self-supervised
learning leverages the vast amounts of unlabeled data to predict future
market movements, enabling the RL agent to anticipate potential future
changes rather than relying solely on historical data. Together, these
approaches enhance the RL agent’s ability to make more informed and
proﬁtable trading decisions in volatile and unpredictable markets.
The main contributions of this paper is listed as follows:
•

Proposing the Incremental Forecast Fusion Deep Reinforcement
Learning (IFF-DRL) in single-asset trading, which combining the concept of incremental learning and self-supervised learning to improve
trading performance.
• Developing a new types of data, namely daily & weekly data, that
are diﬀerent from traditional OHLCV data, which can help reinforcement learning agent see a more macro-level stock price patterns.
• Incorporating self-supervised time-series prediction network AutoConNet to predict future ﬁnancial price data, which largely improve
the accuracy of predicting price trend and the ability of capturing
the pattern.
• Using incremental learning algorithm—online EWC during testing
phase, which greatly improve the prediction accuracy of AutoConNet, and thus enhancing the trading performance of reinforcement
learning agent.
• The proposed framework was evaluated using three reinforcement
learning algorithms: DDQN, A2C, and PPO. Experiments conducted
on six widely-used datasets, encompassing indices such as DJI,
FCHI, SP500, KS11, and N225, demonstrate that the framework consistently outperforms various traditional and Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL)-based methods. These results underscore the framework’s potential to optimize stock trading strategies and enhance the
reliability of algorithmic trading by eﬀectively combining reinforcement learning with forecasts of future stock price movements.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant
prior studies on the topic. In Section 3, the proposed method is described
in detail. Section 4 presents and analyzes the experimental results. The
advantages and limitations of the current research are discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the key ﬁndings and outlines directions for future work.
2. Related work
Financial time series modeling, as an important application area of
time series analysis, has already been deeply explored and applied in
the ﬁnancial sector.
2.1. Incremental learning
Incremental learning involves continuously learning new knowledge
from new samples while retaining the already learned knowledge. By
adjusting model parameters to integrate new and old data, it simulates the continuous learning mode of humans without the need for
a complete retraining, and has shown distinct advantages in the ﬁeld
of time series analysis. Incremental learning is particularly suitable for
handling large-scale, high-dimensional, and dynamically changing time
series data. It can eﬀectively reduce the time cost required for model updates and signiﬁcantly alleviate the problem of catastrophic forgetting.
The core of incremental learning lies in maintaining the model’s memory of old knowledge while learning new knowledge when new data is
introduced, similar to the “stability-plasticity dilemma” in the nervous

system (Grossberg, 2012), which seeks a balance between stability and
plasticity.
Prior to the rise of deep learning technologies, there had already been
research on incremental learning. However, these studies were mostly
conﬁned to handling incremental learning between old and new tasks,
and were primarily based on traditional machine learning models, making it diﬃcult to cope with the challenges of long-term, large-scale data
in modern data streams. With the rapid development of deep learning,
particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), their powerful representational capabilities have made deep learning-based incremental learning
a potent tool for addressing these issues. The emergence of Vision Transformers (ViT) and pretrained models has turned deep learning-based
incremental learning into a research hotspot, providing new solutions
for handling complex visual tasks and data streams. Additionally, Ehret
and colleagues demonstrated the eﬀectiveness and potential of incremental learning in processing time series data by evaluating Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) on time series datasets (Ehret et al., 2020).
Furthermore, the incremental approach’s capability to signiﬁcantly alleviate catastrophic forgetting in time series data has been validated in
tasks such as Stroke-MNIST (Gulcehre, Chandar, & Bengio, 2017) and
AudioSet (Gemmeke et al., 2017).
Currently, the application of incremental learning in time series analysis exempliﬁes its advantages in handling large-scale dynamic data,
quickly adapting to new data, and alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
With the continuous advancement of deep learning technologies, particularly the rise of self-supervised models, deep learning-based incremental learning will showcase its immense potential and value in even
more domains.

aligns with the global autocorrelation measured in the data space. This
approach helps the model learn long-term representations and enhances
its ability to predict long-term changes.
By combining contrastive learning and other SSL techniques, the
model’s discriminative ability and adaptability to new data can be
further enhanced (Jing et al., 2024). This strategy not only improves
the model’s predictive performance but also provides new insights and
methods for time series analysis. As SSL has already made signiﬁcant
progress in the ﬁeld of time series analysis and ﬁnance, further exploration of the integration of SSL with other techniques and optimization
strategies in diﬀerent application scenarios is warranted to drive continuous development in time series analysis and the ﬁnancial domain.
2.3. Deep reinforcement learning in algorithmic trading
Algorithmic trading is a method of executing buy and sell orders automatically using computer programs and mathematical models. This
type of trading determines the timing, price, and quantity of orders
based on predeﬁned trading strategies and algorithms, thereby avoiding
human interference and improving eﬃciency and accuracy. The rise of
algorithmic trading has dramatically transformed the landscape of ﬁnancial markets, with its eﬃciency and speed enabling large-scale trading (Gupta, Singh, Kumar et al., 2022). Machine learning, as a core tool
in this ﬁeld, optimizes market eﬃciency and aids in generating excess
returns by deeply mining complex relationships and patterns within historical data.
In recent years, with the continuous advancement of machine learning technology and the massive increase in ﬁnancial data, the design
of algorithmic trading strategies has become more complex and precise. For example, in ﬁnancial markets, the application of deep learning
in trading algorithms has signiﬁcantly improved the accuracy of stock
return predictions. Complex neural networks structures capture market patterns and trends that are diﬃcult to identify using traditional
methods, and they process large amounts of data to extract key features
(Wang & Yan, 2021). Compared to traditional methods, deep learning
demonstrates higher predictive stability and accuracy (Vijayarani, Suganya, & Jeevitha, 2020; Wu et al., 2020). At the same time, reinforcement learning dynamically adjusts strategies to maximize returns, creating more ﬂexible and adaptive trading strategies that eﬀectively respond
to market ﬂuctuations, capture trading opportunities, and reduce risk
(Ghania, Awaisa, & Muzammula, 2019). Deep reinforcement learning,
by combining the feature extraction capabilities of deep learning with
the strategy optimization capabilities of reinforcement learning, better
adapts to market complexities and nonlinear relationships, enhancing
the stability and proﬁtability of trading (Yang et al., 2020).
Recent research has revealed signiﬁcant advancements and integration trends of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in solving more
generalized algorithmic trading problems. For instance, the introduction of Probabilistic Knowledge Transfer (PKT) to optimize the distillation method of DRL agents has successfully improved the training process of these agents, signiﬁcantly enhancing training stability
(Moustakidis, Passalis, & Tefas, 2024). Additionally, an innovative algorithm based on the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm utilizes a simpliﬁed reward function with delayed feedback mechanisms to promote
model reinforcement learning, simplifying the decision-making process
and providing a more ﬂexible and adaptive reward mechanism. This,
in turn, drives improvements in returns management and risk control
(de Azevedo Takara, Santos, Mariani, & dos Santos Coelho, 2024). In
terms of model integration, a feature extractor based on GraphSAGE
has been integrated into the PPO agents’ architecture. This integration
strategy signiﬁcantly boosts the model’s ability to recognize key features of stock market data, thereby enhancing its performance in portfolio optimization tasks. Its integration advantage has been eﬀectively
validated across diﬀerent market scenarios (Sun, Wei, & Yang, 2024).
Furthermore, the DRL framework has innovatively incorporated a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network combined with

2.2. Self-Supervised learning
Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a method that leverages unlabeled
data by designing auxiliary tasks to mine data features for training models. It has gradually become a powerful tool in the ﬁeld of time series
analysis. By utilizing unlabeled time series data to train models, SSL
signiﬁcantly reduces the dependency on costly labeled data. Its core advantage lies in its ability to capture the intrinsic structure and patterns
of time series data, thereby helping models better understand and predict future trends. For example, SSL models based on Transformers, such
as Pyraformer (Liu et al., 2021) and Informer (Zhou et al., 2021a), have
successfully applied SSL to time series forecasting tasks by introducing
innovative methods like sparse attention mechanisms and time-aware
decomposition strategies.
To more deeply explore the complex structure of time series, MICN
(Wang et al., 2023) and CoST (Woo, Liu, Sahoo, Kumar, & Hoi, 2022)
decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and other components,
and perform SSL learning and prediction for these components separately. This approach, by decomposing the diﬀerent components of the
time series, allows the model to focus more on the feature learning of
each component, thereby improving the accuracy of predictions. Additionally, CDformer (Liu, Zhuang, Gao, & Qin, 2024) utilizes local linear
scaling approximation (LLSA) encoding mutations, decomposes the time
series into trend and seasonality, and achieves high-precision predictions by adding the predictions from MLP and wavelet attention mechanisms. It has shown excellent performance on datasets, demonstrating
its potential in ﬁnancial time series forecasting and trading.
AutoCorrelation-based Contrastive Loss Network (AutoConNet) is a
network model designed for long-term forecasting using autocorrelation
(Park, Gwak, Choo, & Choi, 2024). In real-world scenarios, time series
often exhibit diﬀerent long-term and short-term variations. Long-term
variations are challenging for models to predict because they cannot be
captured within a typical window. AutoConNet addresses this by sampling from long time series to obtain discrete window data. It then calculates the global autocorrelation coeﬃcient for each pair of windows
using an autocorrelation function. The model is designed with a loss
function that ensures the similarity between window representations

C. Zhou et al.

an attention mechanism. This innovative fusion further enhances the
model’s ability to identify key features in stock market data (Huang
et al., 2024a). Additionally, LSTM and CNN have been integrated
into the deep reinforcement learning framework as multi-agents, eﬀectively overcoming traditional issues of value function overestimation
and overﬁtting. Compared to single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, this strategy shows better performance and more stable returns
(Cheng & Sun, 2024). The multi-agent approach built on a Double Deep
Q-Network, employing TimesNet and multi-scale convolutional neural
networks, achieves eﬀective risk balancing through innovative integration and obtains considerable returns in complex stock market trading
(Huang et al., 2024c). These research advancements collectively highlight the immense potential and vast prospects of DRL technology in the
ﬁeld of ﬁnancial trading strategy optimization.
These studies not only demonstrate the potential of DRL in algorithmic trading, but also reveal its advantages over traditional methods,
including the ability to adapt to market changes, avoid emotional biases, and accelerate trade execution. With the continuous development
of DRL, the research prospects in the ﬁeld of algorithmic trading are
vast, and there is hope that it will further drive innovation and transformation in ﬁnancial markets in the future.

evolves over time due to changes in investor behavior, market conditions, and external shocks. This dynamic view allows the proposed
model to adapt to variations in market eﬃciency, enabling it to respond to unexpected events and shifting market dynamics.
2. Considering the complexities of stock market liquidity and the relatively small scale of assets being analyzed, particularly from the
perspective of individual investors, this paper assumes that the impact of individual buy or sell orders on market prices is negligible. As
a result, a single trade is presumed not to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on price movements.
3. There is no slippage in the execution of orders, meaning the market
assets possess suﬃcient liquidity to ensure that trades are executed
at the quoted prices without any deviation.
3.1. Overview of the proposed method
In this section, we present an overview of the proposed method.
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the framework combines reinforcement learning with a self-supervised time series prediction network. The process
begins by introducing a pre-trained self-supervised network to forecast
OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) values for the next 𝑛 days,
using past OHLCV data as input. These predictions, along with the actual observed data, form the state input to the reinforcement learning
model. The state representation is designed with two components. The
ﬁrst, 𝑠𝑑𝑡 , includes the observed OHLCV data at time 𝑡. The second, 𝑠𝑤
𝑡 ,
aggregates both observed and predicted data into weekly OHLCV summaries. Then, the 𝑠𝑑𝑡 and 𝑠𝑤
𝑡 are concatenated to form the daily & weekly
data called 𝑠𝑓𝑡 , which is served as the input state 𝑠 of the reinforcement
learning algorithm. By combining these 𝑠𝑑𝑡 and 𝑠𝑤
𝑡 , the model beneﬁts
from both ﬁne-grained daily patterns and broader weekly trends, enhancing decision-making capabilities. In the testing phase, we employ
the online Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) method to enable incremental learning within the prediction network. This approach helps the
network retain previously learned knowledge while adapting to new
data, ensuring consistent prediction accuracy. By maintaining the selfsupervised network’s learning capability, the overall framework demonstrates improved robustness and adaptability in dynamic environments.

3. Method
In algorithmic trading, the process of selecting and executing trading strategies can be eﬀectively modeled as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP), making it a natural ﬁt for reinforcement learning (RL). Within
this framework, ﬁnancial reinforcement learning agents strive to identify the optimal trading strategy by exploring and evaluating the consequences of diﬀerent actions in a dynamic trading environment. However, to thoroughly investigate the application of RL in complex ﬁnancial markets and to ensure the robustness and reliability of the results,
it is essential to establish several key assumptions:
1. The market operates under dynamic eﬃciency, integrating both the
Eﬃcient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) and the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (AMH). EMH assumes that market prices reﬂect all available information, while AMH acknowledges that market eﬃciency

3.2. Problem formulation

return-based reward function that balances short-term and long-term returns over a ﬂexible time horizon. By considering the maximum returns
from various positions and incorporating an adaptable time window, the
function eﬀectively captures trends from both short-term and long-term
perspectives, ultimately aiming to maximize overall returns. Notably,
the ﬂexibility of this reward function allows for ﬁne-tuning between
short-term and long-term objectives by adjusting the time horizon parameter 𝑚, making it adaptable to the unique characteristics of diﬀerent
stocks. Additionally, the function is designed to emphasize information
relevant to the agent’s positions. The mathematical formulation of the
proposed reward function is provided in Eqs. (5) to (7).

The state provides a representation of the environment at time 𝑡,
oﬀering the agent the necessary information to make informed decisions. As mentioned earlier, the training data is organized into daily
and weekly datasets. The daily data consists of observed OHLCV (Open,
High, Low, Close, Volume) values, while the weekly data is generated by
combining predicted prices with observed ones. In this context, the state
can be categorized into daily state and weekly state. The daily state, denoted as 𝑠𝑑𝑡 , is a collection of features including the opening price, high
price, low price, closing price, and trading volume (OHLCV) over the
past 𝑛 days. The daily state can be denoted as:
𝑠𝑑𝑡 = {𝑂𝑛𝑑 , 𝐻𝑛𝑑 , 𝐿𝑑𝑛 , 𝐶𝑛𝑑 , 𝑉𝑛𝑑 }𝑡 .

an action 𝑎𝑡 guided by the RL policy. In this study, which focus on algorithmic trading, the agent has only three actions, namely buy, hold,
and sell. The computation of actions can be represented as:
⎧−1, if 𝜋(𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑓𝑡 ) = Sell;

where 𝑆 = (𝑠1 , …, 𝑠𝑇 ) is the entire time series, 𝑇 denotes the length of

the lag ℎ is the distance between two windows.
By implementing a mini-batch comprised of widely separated windows through global autocorrelation, where the time distance can span
the entire sequence length and exceed the window length, the model is
endowed with the capability to handle long-term dependencies by establishing relations between global windows. Set a ﬁxed-length 𝑊 window on 𝑆 as 𝐷 = {𝑊𝑡 }𝑀

two windows at the same phase (𝑖.𝑒., 𝑖 = 𝑗) has the same value |𝑡1 − 𝑡2 |.
The relationship between two windows is deﬁned using the global autocorrelation function 𝑅𝑠𝑠 (|𝑡1 − 𝑡2 |) as follows:

3.2.2. Reward function
The reward function plays a critical role in the reinforcement learning framework, serving as a measure of the immediate feedback or reward an agent receives based on its actions in a speciﬁc state. In the context of algorithmic trading, this function typically reﬂects the proﬁtability or performance of the trading strategy. Building on the approach proposed by Huang, Zhou, Cui, and Lu (2024b), this paper utilizes a novel

AutoConNet, as shown in Fig. 2, uses autocorrelation to identify longterm changes. For example, it samples three windows from diﬀerent
times 𝑡1 , 𝑡2 , and 𝑡3 of an entire time series to form a batch. These form
three possible positive pairs(i.e., due to three anchors), and for each positive pair, a global autocorrelation is calculated. The lag is the distance
between the two windows that make up the pair. The calculated positive
pairs are then compared for autocorrelation with the remaining pairs,
and those with lower autocorrelation than the anchored positive pair
are considered negative pairs. AutoConNet obtains the autocorrelation
function 𝑅𝑠𝑠 (ℎ) from the real discrete process {𝑆𝑡 } using the following
equation:

where 𝜋(𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑓𝑡 ) is RL policy that computed by the reinforcement learning
agent at time step 𝑡.
The trading actions executed by the agent may diﬀer from the trading signals generated by the policy network. For instance, if the account
is already holding a short position (POS𝑡 = −1), a sell signal simply indicates maintaining the existing short position. In this case, the actual
action taken is “hold” rather than “sell.” This adjustment arises from
trading rules that prohibit additional buying while a long position is
held, as well as further short selling while in a short position. Table 1
provides a detailed explanation of how actual trading operations are determined based on the combination of the current account position and
the generated trading signals.

Fig. 2. The structure of AutoConNet.

Autocorrelation-based Contrastive Loss (𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜𝐶𝑜𝑛 ), the input 𝑋 ∈ ℝ𝑁×𝐼 ,
which contains 𝑁 windows, is fed into an encoder to obtain the representation 𝑣 ∈ ℝ𝑁×𝐼×𝑑 through 𝑣 = 𝐸𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒(,  ). For ease of explanation, 𝑐 is set to 1. Here, using 𝑖 as the window index, and 𝑟(𝑖,𝑗) =
𝑟( (𝑖) ,  (𝑗) ) represents the global correlation between two windows, the
formula for the loss 𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜𝐶𝑜𝑛 is calculated based on the representation
{𝑣(𝑖) }𝑁
with the corresponding time sequence { (𝑖) }𝑁
as follows:
𝑖=1
𝑖=1
𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜𝐶𝑜𝑛 = −

×

The MA block at the head of the long-term branch smooths out shortterm ﬂuctuations, enabling the branch to focus more on long-term information. The loss function  for the redesigned architecture is formulated
as follows:
 = 𝑀𝑆𝐸 + 𝜆 ⋅ 𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜𝐶𝑜𝑛 .

Finally, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and AutoCon loss are combined
with weight 𝜆 as hyperparameters to optimize the objective function .
AutoConNet constructs weekly OHLCV data using both predicted and
observed data as input for the reinforcement learning model. This allows
the model to suﬃciently learn long-term representations from global information, enhancing its ability to predict long-term changes. As shown
in Fig. 2, the AutoConNet framework.

where 𝑆𝑖𝑚(⋅, ⋅) measures the similarity between two representations,
There are a total of 𝑁 × (𝑁 − 1) possible pairs indexed by (𝑖, 𝑗). For each
pair (serving as an anchor pair), any pair whose global autocorrelation
𝑟(𝑖,𝑘) is less than 𝑟(𝑖,𝑗) is considered a negative pair, designating the anchor
pair itself as a relatively positive pair. Additionally, 𝑟(𝑖, 𝑗) is introduced
as a weight to diﬀerentiate the positive pairs with varying degrees of
correlation, minimizing 𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜𝐶𝑜𝑛 .
AutoConNet is designed with three main features to adhere to shortterm temporal locality and the global nature of long-term predictions.
Firstly, use window normalization and denormalization to mitigate
the issue of distribution shift brought about by the non-stationarity of
real-world time series (Kim et al., 2021). The formula is:
𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 =  − ,

𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 = (𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡 + 𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔 ) + ,

3.4. Online elastic weight consolidation
Online Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017)
is an incremental learning algorithm that helps prevent catastrophic forgetting (French, 1999) by selectively constraining updates to the neural
network’s parameters based on their importance to previously learned
tasks. This is particularly useful in settings where the model must adapt
to new data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge.
The central idea behind EWC is to regularize the loss function to penalize large changes in important parameters. The importance of each
parameter is measured using the Fisher Information Matrix, which captures how sensitive the model’s predictions are to changes in these parameters. The online EWC approach builds upon the traditional EWC by
consolidating knowledge continuously across tasks or streaming data
without explicit task boundaries. The loss function for online EWC can
be deﬁned as:
𝜆∑
(𝜔) = new (𝜔) +
Ω (𝜔 − 𝜔∗𝑖 )2 ,
(16)
2 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖

(11)

where  is the mean of the input sequence.
Secondly, for the short-term Branch for Temporal Locality (Zeng,
Chen, Zhang, & Xu, 2023), a linear layer is used for short-term prediction, with the formula being:
𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡 = 𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑟(𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 ).

(12)

where the new (𝜔) is the standard loss function on the current task
or new data, 𝜆 is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-oﬀ between
plasticity (adaptation to new data) and stability (retaining old knowledge), 𝜔𝑖 are the current parameters of the model, 𝜔∗𝑖 are the parameters learned from previous data or tasks, Ω𝑖 represents the importance
of each parameter 𝜃𝑖 , computed based on the Fisher Information Matrix.
The Fisher Information Matrix 𝐹𝑖 is used to estimate the importance
of the parameters. For each parameter 𝜔𝑖 , its importance is deﬁned as:

And for the Long-term Branch for Temporal Globality, the AutoCon
method’s encoder-decoder architecture is used to learn long-term representations by leveraging sequential and global information, with the
formula being:
𝑣 = 𝐸𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒(𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 ,  ).

(15)

(13)

Finally, the network model uses a Temporal Convolutional Network
(TCN) (Bai, Kolter, & Koltun, 2018), and the decoder adopts Multi-scale
Moving Average (MA) blocks (Wang et al., 2023). With diﬀerent kernel
sizes K, it captures multiple periods based on representation 𝑣, with the
formula as follows:

3.5. Incremental forecasting fusion double deep Q-Network
The proposed Incremental Forecasting Fusion Deep Reinforcement
Learning (IFF-DRL) framework can incorporate various RL algorithms,
including value-based methods, policy-based methods and Actor-Critic
based methods. In this section, a classical value-based method called
Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) is introduced as an example to illustrate the basic logic of the proposed framework. DDQN is a special
edition of DQN that designed to address the problem of overestimation. The operational dynamics of the DDQN rely on two neural networks: the main network (𝜃) and the target network (𝜃 − ). For each action taken, a transition tuple (𝑠𝑓𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑟𝑡 , 𝑠𝑓𝑡+1 ) is generated, where 𝑠𝑓𝑡 is
the fusion state generated by the predicted price and observed price. In
this process, the main network (𝜃) selects the next action 𝑎max (𝑠𝑓𝑡+1 ; 𝜃) =

3.6. IFF-DDQN training
The training procedure of IFF-DDQN is illustrated in Algorithm 1 and
the ﬂowchart of IFF-DDQN is shown in Fig. 3. First, a dataset that span
from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2020 is used to train a time-series
prediction network. The error between the predicted and actual values
is calculated by mean square error function. The parameters of the network 𝜔 are then updated through gradient descent. Once the training
of 𝜔 is ﬁnished, the time-series prediction network is transferred to the
DDQN algorithm. Initially, a state 𝑠𝑑𝑡 is observed and passed through 𝜔,
the predicted values then generated. Weekly state 𝑠𝑤
𝑡 is then constructed
with predicted values and observed state 𝑠𝑑𝑡 . After that, a complete state
𝑠𝑓𝑡 is generated by the concatenation of 𝑠𝑑𝑡 and 𝑠𝑤
𝑡 . By observing the
state 𝑠𝑓𝑡 , the DDQN agent samples an action 𝑎𝑡 , which leads to a new
state 𝑠𝑑𝑡+1 due to the Markov Decision Process (MDP). A new complete

argmax𝑎𝑡+1 𝑄(𝑠𝑓𝑡+1 , 𝑎𝑡+1 ; 𝜃). The immediate reward 𝑟𝑡 is then received by
the agent. It is worth to notice that, this method promotes alignment
with higher rewards, encouraging more proﬁtable and strategically advantageous trading decisions. Consequently, the system enhances the
overall performance of the trading strategy. The update rule for the
DDQN is given by Eq. (18):

state 𝑠𝑓𝑡+1 is then generated by the aforementioned process. With the

𝑄(𝑠𝑓𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ; 𝜃) ← 𝑄(𝑠𝑓𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ; 𝜃) + 𝛼[𝑟𝑡 + 𝛾𝑄(𝑠𝑓𝑡+1 , 𝑎max (𝑠𝑓𝑡+1 ; 𝜃); 𝜃 − ) − 𝑄(𝑠𝑓𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ; 𝜃)],

transition tuple (𝑠𝑓𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑟𝑡 , 𝑠𝑓𝑡+1 ), DDQN agent updates its parameters by
temporal diﬀerence (td) learning technique. During testing phase, EWC
method is introduced to improve the prediction accuracy of the selected
time-series network.

4.2.1. Metrics for trading performance
To provide an objective and comprehensive assessment of the proposed method, this paper utilizes four key investment performance metrics.
•

Cumulative Return (CR): This metric reﬂects the total return generated on investments over the evaluation period (Luenberger, 2009).
• Annualized Return (AR): Representing the average return achieved
annually, AR provides a normalized measure of performance over
time (Luenberger, 2009).
• Sharpe Ratio (SR): This risk-adjusted performance metric evaluates
the excess return per unit of volatility, comparing the strategy’s returns to a risk-free benchmark (Sharpe, 1994).
• Maximum Drawdown (MDD): This metric quantiﬁes the largest peakto-trough decline in portfolio value over a given period, highlighting
potential downside risk (Magdon-Ismail & Atiya, 2004).

By addressing diﬀerent dimensions of return, risk, and volatility, these
metrics oﬀer a well-rounded evaluation of the investment strategy’s performance.
4.2.2. Metrics for prediction accuracy
To evaluate the predictive accuracy, this study employs four widely
used error metrics.
•

Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE calculates the average squared difference between predictions and actual values, assigning greater
weight to larger errors due to the squaring operation (Bishop &
Nasrabadi, 2006).
• Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE computes the average absolute difference between predicted and observed values, oﬀering a straightforward measure of prediction error in the same units as the original
data (Willmott & Matsuura, 2005).
• Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE, derived as the square root
of MSE, provides a scale-sensitive error metric that is easier to interpret while maintaining sensitivity to larger deviations (Chai &
Draxler, 2014).
• Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): MAPE expresses the error
as a percentage of the actual values, making it particularly useful
for comparing model performance across datasets of varying magnitudes (Hodson, 2022).

4.3. Baseline methods
To assess the robustness of the proposed model, six major stock indices from diﬀerent regions are selected for evaluation: CAC40 (FCHI)
from France, representing the 40 largest companies on the Paris Stock
Exchange; KOSPI (KS11) from Korea, covering all companies listed on

To better evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed method, several
classic algorithmic trading methods and some cutting-edge ﬁnancial reinforcement learning algorithms are introduced as baseline methods.

Fig. 4. Close price curve of six stock indices.

The classic methods include Buy and Hold (B&H), Sell and Hold (S&H),
Mean Reversion with Moving Averages (MR), and Trend Following with
Moving Averages (TF). The cutting-edge ﬁnancial reinforcement learning algorithms include TDQN, DQN-Vanilla, and Fire (DQN-HER).
The B&H strategy involves an investor purchasing an asset and holding it for the duration of the investment period, without reacting to price

ﬂuctuations. In contrast, the S&H strategy requires the investor to shortsell an asset at the start of the period and maintain this position until
the end. MR strategies are based on the assumption that asset prices
will revert to their historical averages, with this study using a 10-day
Simple Moving Average (SMA) to identify potential reversion points. TF
strategies, commonly employed in algorithmic trading, leverage moving averages to generate trading signals. For this analysis, we use 10day and 20-day SMAs to identify possible trading opportunities. The
TDQN, introduced by Théate and Ernst (Théate & Ernst, 2021), aims
to optimize trading positions using a ﬁve-layer fully connected Deep
Q-Network. The DQN-Vanilla, developed by Taghian et al. (Taghian,
Asadi, & Safabakhsh, 2022), utilizes a simpler two-layer fully connected
network to make trading decisions based on stock OHLC data. Additionally, the Fire (DQN-HER) model, proposed by Cornalba et al. (Cornalba,
Disselkamp, Scassola, & Helf, 2024), explores multi-objective deep
reinforcement learning for trading in both stock and cryptocurrency
markets. This model incorporates dynamic reward functions and discount factors to improve learning outcomes.

The proposed method is trained separately on six distinct stock index
datasets, and after the training phase, the model’s performance is evaluated using the corresponding test set for each dataset. This evaluation
approach assesses the model’s ability to accurately predict actions across
various stock markets by training on multiple datasets. Table 2 provides
the details of the hyperparameters for the three reinforcement learning
methods. Additionally, the initial capital is set at $500,000, and a transaction cost of 0.3 % is applied to the total amount of each trade. In this

article, the selection of the agent network follow settings from previous
work. (Huang et al., 2024c; Zhou, Huang, Cui, & Lu, 2024) Also, sliding window is selected as the data sampling method during the training
and testing phases. The hardware and software used are listed as follows: the processor is 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700KF, the GPU
is NVIDIA RTX 4090 with the 24GB memory. The software versions used
are: Python is v3.10, Pytorch is v1.12, and cuda is v12.1. The operating
system is Windows 10.

ally, studies related to incremental learning have shown that networks
based on self-supervised learning tend to be more robust when combined
with incremental learning algorithms compared to other networks. Consequently, a comparative analysis was conducted on three outstanding
networks in the time series forecasting ﬁeld-AutoConNet, PatchTST, and
SimMTM (Dong et al., 2024)-to select the most suitable network for
the proposed method. Table 4 presents a comparison of the MSE, MAE,
RMSE and MAPE of these three networks on the selected dataset and
Fig. 5 shows the close price curve predicted by three networks versus
the real trend. Also, the hyperparameters for training the three networks
are provided in Table 3.
It can be seen from Table 4 and Fig. 5 that, PatchTST performed the
worst compared to the other two networks. As shown in Fig. 5, AutoConNet and SimMTM demonstrate similar prediction performance, with
both models successfully capturing the overall price movement trends.
These models eﬀectively predict the general direction of price changes,
showcasing their strong predictive capabilities. In contrast, PatchTST
performs considerably worse across all datasets, with the exception of
the DJI dataset, where it shows some reasonable accuracy. In many
cases, PatchTST fails to predict the price direction correctly, leading to
substantial errors. The experimental results, presented in Table 4, further emphasize the performance gap between PatchTST and the other
two models. PatchTST often shows Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) values that are 5–10 times higher than those

4.5. Experimental results
4.5.1. Analysis of time-series prediction network
As previously mentioned, the proposed method uses predicted stock
price data for several future days by a time series forecasting network as input to the reinforcement learning agent. This provides the
agent with potential future market trends as a reference when making trading decisions, leading to better trading outcomes. Therefore, to
enable the reinforcement learning agent to make more informed decisions, a careful evaluation of existing cutting-edge time series forecasting networks is essential. Recent research has revealed that many
widely-recognized works in time series forecasting, such as PatchTST
(Nie, Nguyen, Sinthong, & Kalagnanam, 2022) and AutoConNet (Park
et al., 2024), are based on self-supervised learning principles. AdditionTable 4

observed for AutoConNet and SimMTM, indicating its overall inferior
performance.
When comparing AutoConNet and SimMTM, we ﬁnd that their
performance metrics-including MSE, MAE, Root Mean Square Error
(RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)-are quite similar,
with only slight variations between them. However, on a broader scale,
AutoConNet consistently outperforms SimMTM across all six datasets,
albeit with marginal improvements. This suggests that AutoConNet is a
more robust model for the task at hand, achieving better overall prediction accuracy and stability.

Therefore, it can be concluded that AutoConNet is better suited for
the objectives of this study, oﬀering a slight yet consistent advantage
over SimMTM in terms of predictive performance.
4.5.2. Comparison with baselines
To better assess the eﬀectiveness of the proposed method, the test
results of the IFF-DRL agent have been used for comparative analysis
against the baselines mentioned earlier.
It is worth noting that although the proposed method introduces an
incremental learning algorithm during the testing phase to enhance the

pre-trained time series forecasting network, AutoConNet, with continuous learning capabilities and improved prediction accuracy, the incremental learning algorithm will not be applied in this phase. The focus here is to validate the improvement in the reinforcement learning
agent’s performance through the use of daily & weekly data generated
from both predicted and observed prices. On the other hand, to verify
whether the proposed method improves performance across diﬀerent reinforcement learning algorithms, three classical algorithms-DDQN, A2C,
and PPO-were integrated into the proposed framework, and called IFFDDQN, IFF-A2C, and IFF-PPO, respectively. The detailed experimental
results are shown in Table 5. As shown in Table 5, the proposed method
outperformed all baseline approaches in terms of CR, SR, AR, and MDD.
Across the six datasets involved in the experiments, IFF-DDQN, IFFA2C, and IFF-PPO each achieved over 390 % CR, while the best baseline method only reached 127.84 % CR. Among the proposed methods,
the one combined with PPO, IFF-PPO, delivered the best performance,
achieving a 1462.42 % CR and 103.19 % AR on the HSI dataset. On the
other hand, IFF-DDQN, the method combined with DDQN, had the lowest performance, with a CR of 395.09 % on the DJI dataset. However,
this still signiﬁcantly exceeded all baseline methods. These results indicate that the proposed method eﬀectively enhances traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling the agent to gain a clearer understanding of price data during both the training and testing phases,
leading to superior trading strategies.

4.5.3. Improving prediction accuracy with incremental learning
As being discussed in the previous sections, an incremental learning algorithm will be introduced into the current framework once the
testing phase is begin. The primary goal of incremental learning is to
enhance the continue learning ability of the selected time-series prediction network, improving its prediction accuracy even during testing. In
this experiment, a classic incremental learning algorithm online EWC
has been used during testing phase. As a variant of EWC method, online EWC is widely used in lots of incremental learning paradigm and
achieved astonishing result in recent years. Detail explanation of online
EWC has shown in Section 3.4.
Table 6 showed the comparative analysis of the prediction accuracy
of AutoConNet before and after incorporating online EWC method in
testing phase. It is evident that the MSE, MAE, RMSE and MAPE has
decreased with the help of incremental learning. Even in KS11 dataset,
which AutoConNet got a extremely small MSE and MAE, online EWC
can still improve its performance.
To further demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed method,
a comparative analysis between current framework with and without
Incremental Learning is necessary. Due to the fact that a lower MSE and
MAE demonstrate a smaller gap between prediction and ground-truth.
Therefore, the proposed method should achieve a better result with the
help of online EWC method. Tables 7–9 have shown the comparison
result.
The bold part of three tables represent the best performance. As introduced in previous section, IFF-DDQN, IFF-A2C and IFF-PPO means

incremental learning during testing phase. In this case, FF-DQN, FF-A2C
and FF-PPO means the proposed method without incremental learning.
It can be observed that with the help of online EWC algorithm, the prediction accuracy of AutoConNet has been increased, resulting an improvement of the performance of three agents. However, not all metrics

showed improvement. By observing the Maximum Drawdown (MDD),
it can be seen that, except for IFF-PPO, the MDD of the other two algorithms decreased to some extent on certain datasets. For example, the
MDD of IFF-DDQN on the FCHI dataset increased from 2.35 % to 7.36 %.
The MDD of IFF-A2C on the DJI dataset increased from 3.42 % to 4.37 %.
These reductions in MDD also made the improvement in CR (cumulative
return) relatively less prominent. Interestingly, the proposed method
showed the most signiﬁcant improvement for the PPO algorithm. IFFPPO not only achieved improvements across all metrics but also outperformed the other two algorithms in average performance. This could, to
some extent, indicate the eﬀectiveness of the PPO algorithm in singleasset trading. Future research could focus on exploring the PPO algorithm further.
However, by observing the experimental results, it can be found that
the results on the HSI dataset are unexpectedly high. The CR on the
other datasets mostly ﬂuctuates between 300 % and 600 %, with only
a few exceeding 600 %. In contrast, all CR values on the HSI dataset
exceed 1100 %. To avoid potential issues, it is necessary to analyze the
dataset. Fig. 6 shows the proportion of closing prices in the test sets of
six datasets that ﬂuctuate by more than 1.5 % over three days. As mentioned earlier, the reward function we used is the Min-Max function,
which assigns the maximum price change ratio over the next three days
as the reward for buying or selling. When the agent chooses to hold, the
reward is calculated as a threshold minus the maximum price change
ratio over those three days, with this threshold set to 1.5 % in our experiments. It is evident from the six pie charts that the HSI dataset has
the highest proportion of closing prices ﬂuctuating over 1.5 %, while the
other datasets show less than half of that proportion, with HSI exceeding 50 %. Notably, the HSI dataset has 31.9 % of its declines surpassing
1.5 %. It’s important to note that our experimental environment allows
the agent to execute short-selling actions, and since a signiﬁcant portion
of HSI is in a downtrend, it is understandable why the experimental results on the HSI dataset are so high.

from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2020, while the test dataset
spans January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023. However, it is widely
known that the Covid-19 pandemic began in January 2020 and lasted
for nearly three years, ending around late 2022. Evidently, the training
dataset used in this study includes part of the data from the pandemic
period. To demonstrate the reliability of the proposed method and its
robustness to unforeseen events, experiments should be conducted using
a training dataset that excludes the pandemic period. The pandemic and
post-pandemic periods would then serve as the test dataset, allowing us
to observe the model’s performance across multiple datasets.
Therefore, the IFF-DRL method was tested on aforementioned six
datasets, where the training set spanned from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2019, and the test set covered January 1, 2020, to December
31, 2023. The experimental results are recorded in Table 10. It can be
observed that, despite the test set length increasing by nearly one year
to a total of four years, the trading performance of IFF-DRL on DJI,
FCHI, HSI, and KS11 is lower than the corresponding results shown in
Tables 7–9, where the test set length was only three years for the same
algorithm. Additionally, a comparison reveals that the experimental results in Table 10 exhibit relatively high Maximum Drawdown (MDD),
with most exceeding 10 %. Even for SP500 and N225, which showed
relatively favorable outcomes, the MDD values remain high. This clearly
demonstrates the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, as an unforeseen event, on trading performance.
To further observe the impact of including or excluding Covid-19 period data in the training set on the trading performance of IFF-DRL, the
models trained in Table 9 will be tested on the test set containing data
from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023. This test set is consistent
with the one used in the experiments of Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.3. The
results of these tests are recorded in Tables 11–13. In these three tables,
IFF-DRL (with Covid-19) refers to the experimental results where the
training set includes data from the pandemic period, which have been
discussed in Section 4.5.3. On the other hand, IFF-DRL (without Covid19) represents the experimental results where the training set excludes
data from the pandemic period.
From the three tables, we can observe that when the training set does
not include data from the pandemic period, the trading performance of
IFF-DRL signiﬁcantly declines. For example, in Table 11, the cumulative return of IFF-DDQN on the DJI dataset dropped from 395.09 % to
73.72 %, while on the HSI dataset, the cumulative return decreased from

4.6. Further analysis of model reliability and robustness
To further validate the reliability and robustness of the proposed
method, it is necessary to evaluate the model’s performance in response
to unexpected events through additional experiments. As described in
Section 4.1, the training dataset used in this study includes price data

1410.73 % to 555.37 %. It is evident that the IFF-DRL algorithm, when
trained without the pandemic data, experienced a decline of more than
50 % in cumulative return across most datasets. Additionally, the increase in Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is also noteworthy. For instance,
IFF-DDQN, IFF-A2C, and IFF-PPO all saw their MDD on the HSI dataset
rise from less than 5 % to over 15 %. Obviously, when the training set excludes the pandemic data, the overall trading performance of IFF-DRL
suﬀers a substantial decline, with many datasets performing less than
half as well as before.
However, when comparing the experimental results from the three
tables with those in Table 5, we can observe that, despite the absence of
the critical pandemic data in the training set, IFF-DRL outperforms traditional methods such as Buy-and-Hold (B&H) and Mean Reversion (MR)
across all datasets. When compared to baseline models such as TDQN,
DQN-HER, and DQN-Vanilla, IFF-DRL also demonstrates superior performance, with better results in most datasets. For example, IFF-DDQN
on DJI dataset achieves only 73.72 % CR, which is lower than the performance of DQN-HER shown in Table 5. However, the annualized return
of IFF-DDQN, which yields 26.39 %, is way better than DQN-HER that
only have 19.21 %. This implies that, although the unforeseen pandemic
event had a negative impact on the proposed method, the approach still
ensures relatively strong trading performance. The method exhibits robustness and adaptability, achieving substantial success even in the face
of missing critical training data.
Based on the above experimental results, three conclusions can be
drawn. First, IFF-DRL is highly reliable and robust, capable of delivering
reliable trading strategies and excellent trading performance when confronted with unknown events. Second, this study incorporates a “short
selling” mechanism within the trading framework, enabling participating agents to take advantage of declining stock prices by executing actions beyond merely buying or holding. By leveraging this capability,
the proposed IFF-DRL framework demonstrates an enhanced ability to
adapt to sudden market downturns. Even during sharp price drops, the
framework can eﬀectively navigate unfavorable conditions and achieve
proﬁtable outcomes, showcasing its robustness in volatile market environments. Third, these experiments demonstrate that IFF-DRL is not an
algorithm that only performs well on data from speciﬁc time periods.
The integration of the self-supervised predictive network enables it to
react to unexpected events, thus avoiding potential large losses. This
shows that the proposed method is adaptable and can maintain strong
performance even in the presence of unforeseen disruptions.

4.7. Analysis of trading strategy
Following the analysis of the IFF-DRL’s eﬀectiveness across various
experiments, the actions taken by the agent within the datasets were
further examined. Figs. 7–9 illustrate the trading actions executed by the
IFF-DDQN agent across three datasets. These actions are superimposed
on stock price trend charts, providing a clear visual representation of
how the agent’s decisions align with price movements, making it easier
to understand the rationale behind its trading strategies.

Fig. 7. Actions of IFF-DDQN Agent in HSI.

Fig. 8. Actions of IFF-DDQN Agent in N225.

Figs. 7 and 9 show the trading actions of the IFF-DDQN agent on
the HSI and N225 datasets. A notable observation is that both datasets
exhibit signiﬁcant price volatility, which can be conﬁrmed by Fig. 6,
as these two datasets have the highest proportion of price ﬂuctuations
exceeding 1.5 % over the next three days. In response to this situation,
the agent employs a high-frequency trading strategy. A close-up view
of Figs. 7 and 9 clearly shows that stock prices experience substantial
short-term ﬂuctuations, and the agent often buys at the lows of these
ﬂuctuations and sells at the highs, undoubtedly resulting in proﬁts.

When the agent encounters a situation with low price volatility, its
strategy also changes accordingly. Taking the zoomed-in section of Fig. 9
as an example, the agent executed a “short” trading decision around
day 325. A few days later, anticipating an upcoming price increase, the
agent switched to a “long” trading decision and then refrained from
trading for nearly 10 days until predicting a long-term downward trend
starting around day 340, at which point it executed a “short” operation.
Therefore, by observing the three ﬁgures, it can be conﬁdently stated
that the agent eﬀectively monitors the market environment and price

6. Conclusion

movement patterns, adjusting its trading strategy appropriately based
on diﬀerent conditions to achieve proﬁts.

This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning framework called Incremental Forecasting Fusion Deep Reinforcement Learning (IFF-DRL), which signiﬁcantly improves the trading performance
of DRL agent in ﬁnancial environment. In the proposed method, selfsupervised learning helps model exploit abundant unlabeled data to uncover complex structures and temporal dependencies and incremental
learning enables models to continuously adjust with new data to improve prediction accuracy. By incorporating a time-series prediction network AutoConNet to predict future price and generate daily & weekly
data based on observed and predicted price data, the agent can not only
see the potential price change pattern in the future, but also observe the
market in a more macro level. In this case, deep reinforcement learning model can extract better latent expression from the data. Moreover,
an incremental learning algorithm, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)
is introduced during testing phase, which enable the time-series network to have the ability to continue learning and also improve its prediction accuracy. This method’s eﬃcacy is validated through extensive
testing across various datasets, including DJI, FCHI, HSI, SP500, N225,
and KS11.
Key contributions of this paper include:

5. Discussion
In this comprehensive analysis of the proposed IFF-DRL, our experiment through various datasets and scenarios demonstrate a consistent outperformance of selected baseline methods, as measured by
CR, AR, SR and MDD. The superiority of the proposed method, detailed
in Table 5, can be attributed to its novel data generation mechanism.
This unique mechanism allow a time-series prediction network to predict price data in the next 𝑁 days base on the observed state, then generate the daily & weekly data that consist of observed and predicted
price data. In this case, once the daily & weekly data is treated as the
input state of reinforcement learning, agent have the chance to not only
making decision by seeing future, but also observe the price data in a
macro-level. This arrangement enhances the consistency and reliability of the learning process, particularly in the volatile environment of
ﬁnancial markets.
Further analysis of prediction accuracy has been shown in Section 4.5.3. The integration of online EWC algorithm increased the prediction accuracy of AutoConNet, resulting in the improvement of the
overall performance of the proposed method. Since ﬁnancial markets
are inherently unstable and continuously evolving, the stock price patterns learned by time series prediction networks in the training set may
not necessarily be eﬀective in the test set. Therefore, the greatest significance of introducing the concept of incremental learning is to enable
the network to maintain its learning capability and, to some extent, improve the accuracy of its predictions. Experiments show that with the
help of the incremental learning algorithm, AutoConNet’s prediction accuracy has been enhanced. Moreover, as the predicted price data more
closely aligns with the real data, the agent made more optimal trading
decisions during the trading process, leading to an overall performance
improvement.
Furthermore, the proposed method not only improves a single deep
reinforcement learning algorithm but also shows signiﬁcant enhancement across several types of algorithms, including value-based, actorcritic based, and policy-based methods. By observing Tables 7–9, it can
be seen that the PPO algorithm demonstrates the best performance under the proposed method.
However, this study has several limitations. First, the experiments
conducted in this research were limited to only a few indices and stocks,
and the potential for generalizing the model to other assets or broader
ﬁnancial markets was not explored. This restriction limits the scalability
of the proposed methods, and future work could focus on testing these
algorithms across a wider range of assets and market conditions to assess
their generalizability.
Second, the study only used daily and weekly OHLCV data as input for the models, without exploring the possibility of incorporating
additional ﬁnancial indicators that could provide more comprehensive
insights into market behavior. Including other features, such as macroeconomic variables, sentiment analysis, or technical indicators, could potentially improve the models’ ability to capture the complexities of ﬁnancial markets and enhance their predictive power.
Third, this research only used online EWC algorithm to improve
the prediction accuracy of AutoConNet and did not explore the use of
other incremental learning methods. However, it does not imply that
online EWC is the only choice for incremental learning algorithms.
Classical methods such as replay buﬀer, online gradient descent, or
recursive least squares can also be applied to the proposed method.
The experiments on incremental learning in this paper aim to explore
whether time series prediction networks with continual learning capabilities lead to better prediction accuracy, and whether higher accuracy improves the agent’s performance in trading. In future work, some
cutting-edge incremental learning methods will be incorporated into the
research.

1. Introducing a novel framework that allow deep reinforcement learning agent can not only see the future price change but also observe
price data in a macro level. As a result, the agent within the proposed
framework can better extract useful latent expression and generate
more optimal trading strategies.
2. The introduction of incremental learning algorithm improves the
overall performance of IFF-DRL signiﬁcantly. Due to the fact that
ﬁnancial market is ever changing, the price evolving pattern that
time-series prediction network learned from training set may not
be suﬃcient when it comes to testing set. In this case, incremental learning algorithm like EWC that being used in this paper enable
the neural network keep learning during testing phase. As result, the
overall prediction MSE of AutoConNet achieved an average reduction of 5.93 % across six datasets, which leads to the improvement
of IFF-DRL’s trading performance.
3. Incorporating self-supervised time-series prediction network
AutoConNet to predict future ﬁnancial price data. Self-supervised
learning enable model to explore uncover complex structures and
temporal dependencies, improving model generalization and pattern
detection. As a result, AutoConNet provides precise prediction of
future data that help improve trading performance.
4. Developing a new types of data, namely daily & weekly data, that
provide a more macro-level perspectives to reinforcement learning
agent, which signiﬁcantly improves the trading eﬃciency.
5. The eﬀectiveness of the proposed framework has been well demonstrated by combining with diﬀerent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Although Algorithm 1 used DDQN to demonstrate the basic
idea of the proposed method, it does not mean that IFF-DRL can only
combined with DDQN. The following experiment result in Section 4
showed that the proposed method can be combined with policybased method like PPO or Actor-Critic based method like A2C.
Despite its strengths, the proposed framework still encounter some
limitations that need to be addressed in the future research. Future work
will focus on expanding the scope of experiments, incorporating additional data sources, and exploring the integration of diﬀerent types of
incremental learning algorithms to further improve the performance of
the proposed methods. Furthermore, the incorporation of more ﬁnancial indicators will be essential for further advancing the capabilities of
ﬁnancial reinforcement learning models.
Data availability
The data that has been used is conﬁdential.
